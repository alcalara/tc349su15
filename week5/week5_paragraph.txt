Out of the two style tiles that I made for my site, I liked my second
tile better. The reason that I liked this tile is because there is 
a more of a color pallete, and I think that it will go along with my site's
subject better. I like how my site's homepage is set up but I really am 
not the biggest fan of the logo that is currently being used. Before my final, is due 
I am going to have my girlfriend who is a graphic designer,
help me design a better logo. If I am being completely honest, I prefer doing 
the mockup more than I do the style tile. I think that the tile method 
definitely serves its purpose, but I peronally like seeing the outline 
of the site with all the color and text.
